<p>This is the sample github repository</p>
<!--Firstly we need to clone the github repository to our system
  git clone url of the repository
  and we can change to respective directory by using command cd
  and we can see the status by using command git status
  these are the statuses Untracked,modified,staged
untracked - the files we are created but not tracked by git
modified - we have modified but not commited
staged- file is ready to be commited means we have added the files
in order to add the files we can done like 
for respective file git add file name 
for all files git add .
After adding we need to commit changes by providing the message
git commit -m "Message"
But it will not directly add to the github we need to push from local(PC) to remote(Github)
In order to perform git push origin main(branch)-->
